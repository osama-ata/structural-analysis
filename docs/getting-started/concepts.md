# Getting Started Concepts

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    This page is under development. Check back soon for comprehensive coverage of structural analysis concepts.

## Overview

This section will cover fundamental concepts needed to work with the structural analysis library effectively.

## Planned Content

- **Engineering Units**: Understanding SI units throughout the library
- **Boundary Conditions**: Different support types and their applications
- **Load Types**: Point, distributed, and moment loads
- **Material Properties**: Elastic modulus, second moment of area, and other key parameters
- **Sign Conventions**: Consistent approach to positive/negative values
- **Safety Factors**: Design load calculations and code compliance
