# Development Roadmap

The structural analysis library is designed to implement a comprehensive range of structural engineering theories. This page outlines the current implementation status and future development plans.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Implemented Theories

#### Beam Theory

- **Euler-Bernoulli**: Classical beam bending theory with deflection, moment, and shear calculations
  - Simply supported and cantilever boundary conditions
  - Point, distributed, and moment loading
  - Analytical verification with known solutions

#### Column Theory  

- **Euler Buckling**: Elastic buckling analysis for long, slender columns
  - Four end conditions: pinned, fixed, fixed-free, fixed-pinned
  - Critical load and slenderness ratio calculations
  - Complete analytical verification suite

### ðŸš§ Planned Theories

The complete theory database is maintained in [`roadmap.csv`](roadmap.csv), which contains detailed information about:

- **Theory Categories**: Beam, Column, Plate/Shell, Dynamic, Material, etc.
- **Theory Names**: Specific methods within each category
- **Descriptions**: Technical overview of each theory
- **Key Assumptions**: Important limitations and assumptions
- **Primary Applications**: Where each theory is most applicable
- **Advantages**: Benefits of each approach
- **Limitations**: Known constraints and limitations

## Priority Implementation Order

1. **Beam Theory Extensions**
   - Timoshenko beam theory (includes shear deformation)
   - Nonlinear beam analysis for large deformations

2. **Column Theory Extensions**
   - Rankine-Gordon formula for combined buckling-crushing
   - Johnson Parabolic formula for inelastic buckling

3. **New Theory Categories**
   - Plane stress/strain analysis
   - Plate bending theory
   - Dynamic analysis methods

## Contributing New Theories

Each theory implementation should follow the established patterns:

1. **Method Signature**: Descriptive parameter names with proper type hints
2. **Return Format**: Dictionary with numpy arrays and scalar max values
3. **Analytical Verification**: Test against known analytical solutions
4. **Documentation**: Complete docstrings with assumptions and applications

See the [Contributing Guide](../contributing.md) for detailed implementation guidelines.

## Theory Database

The complete theory database can be viewed in the [`roadmap.csv`](roadmap.csv) file, which serves as the master reference for all planned implementations.
