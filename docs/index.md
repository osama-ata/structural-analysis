## Quick Example

```python
from structural_analysis import StructuralAnalysis

# Initialize the analysis library
analysis = StructuralAnalysis()

# Analyze a simply supported beam
result = analysis.beam_theory.euler_bernoulli(
    length=4.0,                    # 4 meter beam
    E=200e9,                       # Steel elastic modulus (Pa)
    second_moment=8.33e-6,         # Second moment of area (m‚Å¥)
    load_type="point",             # Point load
    load_magnitude=10000,          # 10 kN load
    load_position=2.0,             # At center
    boundary_conditions="simply_supported"
)

print(f"Max deflection: {result['max_deflection']:.6f} m")
print(f"Max moment: {result['max_moment']:.0f} N¬∑m")
```
