## Example Structure

Each example includes:

1. **Problem Statement**: Clear engineering problem description
2. **Given Data**: All input parameters and assumptions
3. **Solution Approach**: Step-by-step analysis method
4. **Code Implementation**: Complete Python code with explanations
5. **Results Interpretation**: Engineering significance of results
6. **Verification**: Comparison with hand calculations or other methods

## Using the Examples

All examples are designed to be:

- **Self-contained**: Complete with all necessary imports and data
- **Well-commented**: Clear explanations of each step
- **Reproducible**: Can be run directly from the documentation
- **Educational**: Include engineering context and theory background

## Quick Start Example

Here's a simple beam analysis to get started:

```python
from structural_analysis import StructuralAnalysis

# Initialize the library
analysis = StructuralAnalysis()

# Analyze a simply supported beam with point load
result = analysis.beam_theory.euler_bernoulli(
    length=4.0,                    # 4m beam
    E=200e9,                       # Steel (200 GPa)
    second_moment=8.33e-6,         # I-beam section
    load_type="point",             # Point load
    load_magnitude=10000,          # 10 kN
    load_position=2.0,             # Center loading
    boundary_conditions="simply_supported"
)

print(f"Maximum deflection: {result['max_deflection']:.3f} mm")
print(f"Maximum moment: {result['max_moment']:.0f} Nâ‹…m")
```
