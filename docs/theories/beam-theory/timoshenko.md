# Timoshenko Beam Theory

!!! warning "Under Development"
    This theory is planned for implementation. Check the [development roadmap](../../development/roadmap.md) for current status.

## Overview

Timoshenko beam theory extends Euler-Bernoulli theory by including the effects of:

- **Shear deformation**: Accounts for shear strain in the beam
- **Rotary inertia**: Includes rotational effects in dynamic analysis

## When to Use

Timoshenko theory is more accurate than Euler-Bernoulli for:

- **Thick beams**: Length-to-depth ratios < 10
- **Short beams**: Where shear deformation is significant
- **High-frequency dynamics**: When rotary inertia matters
- **Composite materials**: Multi-layer beams with varying properties

## Mathematical Background

The governing equations include both bending and shear:

$$\frac{\partial^2 M}{\partial x^2} = -q(x)$$

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = -q(x)$$

Where shear deformation is included through the shear correction factor.

## Implementation Status

This theory is in the development pipeline. Implementation will include:

- [ ] Shear deformation effects
- [ ] Various shear correction factors
- [ ] Static and dynamic analysis
- [ ] Multiple boundary conditions
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
