# Advanced Structural Theories

!!! warning "Under Development"
    This section contains advanced theories planned for future implementation. Check the [development roadmap](../development/roadmap.md) for current status.

## Overview

Advanced structural theories extend beyond basic beam and column analysis to cover:

- **Plate and shell analysis**: Two-dimensional structural elements
- **Dynamic analysis**: Time-dependent loading and vibrations
- **Nonlinear analysis**: Large deformation and material nonlinearity
- **Specialized methods**: Energy methods, finite element approaches

## Planned Theory Categories

### Plate Theory

Structural analysis of two-dimensional elements:

- **Kirchhoff plate theory**: Thin plate bending
- **Mindlin plate theory**: Thick plate analysis with shear
- **Membrane theory**: In-plane forces in plates

### Dynamic Analysis

Time-dependent structural response:

- **Free vibration**: Natural frequencies and mode shapes
- **Forced vibration**: Response to dynamic loads
- **Modal analysis**: Superposition of vibration modes
- **Seismic analysis**: Earthquake response

### Material Theory

Advanced material modeling:

- **Plasticity theory**: Beyond elastic limit behavior
- **Composite materials**: Multi-layer and fiber-reinforced materials
- **Creep analysis**: Time-dependent deformation
- **Fatigue analysis**: Cyclic loading effects

### Energy Methods

Alternative solution approaches:

- **Virtual work**: Displacement and force methods
- **Castigliano's theorems**: Energy-based analysis
- **Rayleigh-Ritz method**: Approximate solutions
- **Finite element method**: Numerical analysis

## Implementation Priority

1. **Plate theory**: Fundamental 2D analysis capability
2. **Dynamic analysis**: Free and forced vibration
3. **Material nonlinearity**: Plastic analysis methods
4. **Energy methods**: Alternative solution techniques

## Contributing

The library welcomes contributions of advanced theories. Each implementation should:

1. Follow established coding patterns
2. Include comprehensive test suites
3. Provide analytical verification
4. Document theory background and limitations
